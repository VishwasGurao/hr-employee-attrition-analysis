IBM HR Analytics – Employee Attrition Analysis & Prediction

Project Type:
Data Analysis + Machine Learning

Objective:
The main objective of this project is to analyze employee data and
identify the key factors responsible for employee attrition.
Based on the analysis, a machine learning model is built to predict
whether an employee is likely to leave the company or not.

Business Problem:
Employee attrition leads to increased recruitment cost, training cost,
and productivity loss. By predicting attrition in advance, the HR
department can take preventive actions and improve employee retention.

Dataset:
Source: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset
Records: 1470 employees
Target Variable: Attrition (Yes / No)

Folder Structure:
- DATASET:
  Contains the original HR dataset (CSV file).
  Note: Raw data is not modified.

- Notebook:
  Contains the Jupyter Notebook (HR_Attrition_Analysis.ipynb) where:
  - Data cleaning
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature engineering
  - Machine learning modeling
  - Model evaluation
  are performed.

- OUTPUT:
  - images:
    All charts and visualizations generated during EDA.
  - tables:
    CSV files created from analysis results.
  - models:
    Saved machine learning models for future use.

- PROJECT FILE:
  Contains the project description and problem statement provided.

Tools & Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Anaconda

Machine Learning Models Used:
- Logistic Regression
(Additional models can be added for comparison)

Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

Outcome:
The project identifies the most important factors influencing employee
attrition and builds a predictive model that can help HR teams take
data-driven decisions to reduce attrition.
